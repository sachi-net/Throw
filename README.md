# Throw
`Throw` is a unified conditional validator designed for .NET built-in structures and types. `Throw` also simplifies multi-level guard conditions such as `if-else` and `switch` statements into single-line validator. Interneally, `Throw` extends behaviors of built-in types when its namespace is referred within current coding context.
